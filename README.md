- You may see the recipe/text generator I built above. Then, I utilized OpenAI's Big Sleep model. (https://github.com/lucidrains/big-sleep))
- I also built an web app using Streamlit. 
- I integrated Big Sleep model to Text generator locally and tried to use on my computer; however, due to my graphic card does not support CUDA, I could not utilized Big Sleep on my web app. However, the website only contains the recipe/text generator. 
- You may can access the **web app** through here [LINK](https://share.streamlit.io/enesbasbug/food_recipe_generator/main/app.py) https://share.streamlit.io/enesbasbug/food_recipe_generator/main/app.py
